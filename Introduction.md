# Writing Your First Babel Plugin

[Babel](https://babeljs.io) is an integral part of modern JavaScript development, it takes "next-gen JavaScript" (and optionally other syntax like JSX and Flow) and transpiles it into code that can be used in older browsers. It's also used heavily in other non-web contexts, like React Native!

Babel plugins are an important part of this toolchain, and are responsible for transforming source code. In this presentation I'll give an introduction to key concepts in the babel parser, and demonstrate how you can build plugins that can be used in your project.
